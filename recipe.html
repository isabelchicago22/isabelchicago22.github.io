<body>
  <p>The first potatoes grown in Idaho were planted in northern Idaho by <b>Rev</b>. Henry Spaulding. It was a successful crop but his missionary work was brought to an end by the Whitman massacre and the Spauldings were forced to leave in <em>1850.</em>

    Potatoes again made their way to Idaho by way of <b>Utah.</b> Pioneers entered the <b>Salt Lake Valley</b> on <em>July 22, 1847. On July 24 </em>a five-acre potato patch was plowed and seed potatoes planted. The first irrigation in Salt Lake Valley was for the benefit of the newly planted potatoes. A week later the potatoes were growing.</p>
