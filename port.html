      <p>My name is Isabel and I live in Chicago.
          I play volleyball for a club.
          I have a cat named Lexus and we got him when I was only 5.
       I love to hangout with my friends and that is my favorite thing to do afterschool.</p>
      <p><u>
          My favorite thing to do when I play volleyball is to pass beause that is what I am the best at.
          I play ds so I am mostly in back row passing, sometimes I get put in front row to hit too. I go to Lane tech and I am italian so I take italian class which is my first period. I like to go shopping and I love to spend my money. Starbucks is ususally where all of my money is spent.

       <dt>France</dt>
        <dd>France is a beaufiful country and I was so lucky to be able to visit it. There are many different places in france, Paris which is more like a city and it is very popular and has famous locastions like the eiffel tower and Motre dame. There is also a town called nice france and this is very different from Paris, it is more beachy and more rich than Paris.  </dd>
       <dt>Italy</dt>
        <dd>Italy is also a very beautiful country. The food is exceptional especially the pizza. There are many hills in Italy and the views there are incredible. In Italty there are many different markets and they are well priced and the stuff is very unique. </dd>
       <dt>England</dt>
        <dd>England is super cool. There are so many different attractions in London, including the London eye, which is very fun. The buses are very fun to ride and you will never forget the sound of the tube.</dd>
